# MongoDB Standalone Fix - Transaction Error Resolution

## Problem
The booking system was failing with the error:
```
"Transaction numbers are only allowed on a replica set member or mongos"
```

This error occurs because MongoDB transactions require a replica set configuration, but most development environments use standalone MongoDB instances.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Removed Transaction Dependencies**
- Updated `createBooking` function to work without MongoDB transactions
- Modified `cancelBooking` function to remove session usage
- Updated `BarberSchedule` model methods to handle both session and non-session operations

### 2. **Alternative Conflict Prevention**
Instead of database transactions, the system now uses:

#### **Sequential Operations with Error Handling**
```javascript
// 1. Validate and check conflicts
const existingBookings = await Booking.find({...});
const conflictingBooking = existingBookings.find(booking => {...});

if (conflictingBooking) {
  return res.status(409).json({ errorCode: 'BOOKING_CONFLICT' });
}

// 2. Create booking
const booking = new Booking({...});
await booking.save();

// 3. Update schedule with rollback on failure
try {
  await BarberSchedule.markSlotsAsBooked(...);
} catch (scheduleError) {
  // Rollback: Delete the booking if schedule update fails
  await Booking.findByIdAndDelete(booking._id);
  return res.status(409).json({ errorCode: 'SCHEDULE_UPDATE_FAILED' });
}
```

#### **Manual Rollback Logic**
- If schedule update fails after booking creation, the booking is automatically deleted
- If booking cancellation fails to update schedule, error is logged but cancellation proceeds
- Schedule sync utility can fix any inconsistencies

### 3. **Backward Compatibility**
The `BarberSchedule` model methods now support both modes:
```javascript
// With session (for replica sets)
await BarberSchedule.markSlotsAsBooked(barberId, date, startTime, duration, bookingId, session);

// Without session (for standalone)
await BarberSchedule.markSlotsAsBooked(barberId, date, startTime, duration, bookingId, null);
```

## Files Modified

### Backend Controllers
- `back-end/controllers/booking.controller.js`
  - Removed transaction session usage
  - Added manual rollback logic
  - Simplified error handling

### Models
- `back-end/models/barber-schedule.model.js`
  - Made session parameter optional
  - Added conditional session usage

### Utilities
- `back-end/utils/scheduleSync.js`
  - Removed transaction dependencies
  - Simplified sync operations

## Testing the Fix

### 1. **Basic Booking Creation**
```bash
POST /api/bookings
{
  "barberId": "barber_id",
  "serviceId": "service_id", 
  "bookingDate": "2024-07-24T09:00:00.000Z",
  "durationMinutes": 30,
  "customerName": "Test Customer",
  "customerEmail": "test@example.com",
  "customerPhone": "1234567890"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Booking created successfully
- ✅ Schedule slots marked as booked
- ✅ No transaction errors

### 2. **Conflict Prevention**
```bash
# Create first booking at 9:00
POST /api/bookings {...}

# Try to create conflicting booking at 9:00
POST /api/bookings {...}
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ First booking succeeds
- ✅ Second booking fails with BOOKING_CONFLICT error
- ✅ No orphaned data

### 3. **Booking Cancellation**
```bash
DELETE /api/bookings/{bookingId}
{
  "reason": "Customer request"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Booking status changed to 'cancelled'
- ✅ Schedule slots freed up
- ✅ No errors

## Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ **Development Friendly**
- Works with standard MongoDB installations
- No need to configure replica sets for development
- Faster development setup

### ✅ **Production Ready**
- Can easily be upgraded to use transactions in production
- Manual rollback logic provides data consistency
- Schedule sync utility fixes any edge case inconsistencies

### ✅ **Conflict Prevention**
- Still prevents double-booking through validation
- Schedule-based availability checking
- Clear error messages for conflicts

## Limitations and Considerations

### ⚠️ **Race Conditions**
- Small window for race conditions between validation and booking creation
- Mitigated by quick sequential operations and rollback logic
- For high-concurrency environments, consider using replica sets with transactions

### ⚠️ **Data Consistency**
- Manual rollback may occasionally fail
- Schedule sync utility should be run periodically
- Monitor logs for rollback failures

## Production Deployment Options

### Option 1: Keep Standalone Approach
- Suitable for small to medium applications
- Monitor for any data inconsistencies
- Run schedule sync utility daily

### Option 2: Upgrade to Replica Set
- Better for high-concurrency applications
- Restore transaction usage by changing session parameter from `null` to actual session
- Provides stronger consistency guarantees

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Log Monitoring
Watch for these log messages:
- `"Error marking schedule slots as booked"` - Indicates rollback occurred
- `"Successfully marked X slots as booked"` - Normal operation
- `"Successfully unmarked X slots"` - Cancellation worked correctly

### Periodic Maintenance
```bash
# Run schedule sync for consistency
POST /api/barber-schedule/sync-schedule
{
  "barberId": "barber_id",
  "date": "2024-07-24"
}

# Validate schedule consistency
GET /api/barber-schedule/validate-consistency?barberId=barber_id&date=2024-07-24
```

## Conclusion

The system now works reliably with standalone MongoDB while maintaining all booking conflict prevention features. The manual rollback approach provides adequate data consistency for most use cases, and the system can be easily upgraded to use transactions when replica sets are available.
