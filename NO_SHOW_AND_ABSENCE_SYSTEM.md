# No-Show Management & Barber Absence System Implementation

## Overview
Complete implementation of two critical features for the barbershop booking system:
1. **No-Show Management System** - Tracks customer cancellations and blocks repeat offenders
2. **Barber Absence Management System** - Handles barber time-off requests with automatic schedule updates

## Feature 1: No-Show Management System
