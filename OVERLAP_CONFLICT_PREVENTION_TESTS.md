# Overlap Conflict Prevention System Tests

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive tests for the enhanced time slot validation system that prevents overlapping bookings both within the same barber and across different barbers for the same customer.

## Problems Fixed

### ✅ Problem 1: Overlapping Time Slot Validation
**Issue**: System allowed conflicting bookings like:
- 90-minute service from 10:00-11:30
- 60-minute service from 9:30-10:30 (overlaps 10:00-10:30)

**Solution**: Enhanced overlap detection algorithm that checks for ANY time period overlap.

### ✅ Problem 2: Cross-Barber Time Conflict Prevention  
**Issue**: Customers could double-book themselves across different barbers.

**Solution**: Customer-level conflict checking across all barbers for the same date.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Same Barber Overlap Detection

#### Test 1.1: Exact Overlap Prevention
**Setup:**
- Existing booking: 90-minute service, 10:00-11:30
- Attempted booking: 60-minute service, 10:00-11:00

**Expected Result:**
- ❌ Booking rejected with `BOOKING_CONFLICT` error
- Error message: "Time slot conflict detected. Your 60-minute service (10:00 - 11:00) overlaps with an existing 90-minute booking (10:00 - 11:30)."

#### Test 1.2: Partial Overlap Prevention
**Setup:**
- Existing booking: 90-minute service, 10:00-11:30
- Attempted booking: 60-minute service, 9:30-10:30

**Expected Result:**
- ❌ Booking rejected with `BOOKING_CONFLICT` error
- Overlap detected: 10:00-10:30 (30 minutes)
- Clear explanation of the conflict period

#### Test 1.3: End-to-Start Adjacent Booking (Should Succeed)
**Setup:**
- Existing booking: 60-minute service, 10:00-11:00
- Attempted booking: 30-minute service, 11:00-11:30

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Booking succeeds (no overlap, just adjacent)

### Scenario 2: Cross-Barber Conflict Prevention

#### Test 2.1: Customer Double-Booking Prevention
**Setup:**
- Customer has existing booking with Barber A: 60-minute service, 10:00-11:00
- Customer attempts booking with Barber B: 45-minute service, 10:30-11:15

**Expected Result:**
- ❌ Booking rejected with `CUSTOMER_DOUBLE_BOOKING` error
- Error message: "You already have a booking with Barber A during this time (10:00 - 11:00) conflicts with your requested 45-minute service (10:30 - 11:15)."

#### Test 2.2: Customer Non-Overlapping Booking (Should Succeed)
**Setup:**
- Customer has existing booking with Barber A: 60-minute service, 10:00-11:00
- Customer attempts booking with Barber B: 30-minute service, 11:30-12:00

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Booking succeeds (no time overlap)

### Scenario 3: Complex Multi-Booking Scenarios

#### Test 3.1: Multiple Existing Bookings
**Setup:**
- Barber A has bookings: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:30, 12:00-13:00
- Customer attempts: 90-minute service, 9:15-10:45

**Expected Result:**
- ❌ Booking rejected (overlaps with 9:00-9:30 and 10:30-11:30)
- Clear identification of all conflicting periods

#### Test 3.2: Customer with Multiple Existing Bookings
**Setup:**
- Customer has bookings: Barber A (9:00-10:00), Barber C (14:00-15:00)
- Customer attempts with Barber B: 60-minute service, 9:30-10:30

**Expected Result:**
- ❌ Booking rejected due to overlap with Barber A booking

## API Testing

### Test Available Slots API with Customer ID
```bash
GET /api/barber-schedule/available-slots?barberId=123&date=2024-07-24&durationMinutes=90&customerId=customer123
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "available": true,
  "slots": ["09:00", "11:30", "13:00"],
  "totalSlots": 16,
  "availableSlots": 3,
  "bookedSlots": 2,
  "customerConflicts": 1,
  "scheduleBasedFiltering": true
}
```

### Test Validation API with Customer Conflict
```bash
POST /api/barber-schedule/validate-availability
{
  "barberId": "barber123",
  "bookingDate": "2024-07-24T10:30:00.000Z",
  "durationMinutes": 60,
  "customerId": "customer123"
}
```

**Expected Response (Customer Conflict):**
```json
{
  "available": false,
  "reason": "You already have a booking with John Doe during this time (10:00 - 11:00)",
  "conflictType": "CUSTOMER_CONFLICT",
  "conflictingBooking": {
    "id": "booking456",
    "date": "2024-07-24T10:00:00.000Z",
    "duration": 60,
    "barberName": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

### Test Booking Creation with Conflicts
```bash
POST /api/bookings
{
  "barberId": "barber123",
  "serviceId": "service456",
  "bookingDate": "2024-07-24T10:30:00.000Z",
  "durationMinutes": 60,
  "customerId": "customer123",
  "customerName": "Test Customer",
  "customerEmail": "test@example.com",
  "customerPhone": "1234567890"
}
```

**Expected Response (Customer Double-Booking):**
```json
{
  "message": "You already have a booking during this time period...",
  "conflictDetails": {
    "conflictType": "CUSTOMER_CONFLICT",
    "conflictingBarber": "John Doe",
    "overlapStart": "2024-07-24T10:30:00.000Z",
    "overlapEnd": "2024-07-24T11:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "errorCode": "CUSTOMER_DOUBLE_BOOKING"
}
```

## Frontend Integration Tests

### Test 1: TimeSlotPicker Filtering
**Setup:**
- Customer logged in with existing booking at 10:00-11:00
- Viewing available slots for different barber

**Expected Behavior:**
- Slots 9:30, 10:00, 10:30 should be filtered out for 60+ minute services
- Clear indication of why slots are unavailable
- Real-time validation on slot selection

### Test 2: Error Message Display
**Setup:**
- Customer attempts to book conflicting time slot

**Expected Behavior:**
- Different error icons and colors for different conflict types:
  - ⚠️ Yellow for customer double-booking
  - ❌ Red for barber conflicts
- Longer display duration for customer conflicts (10 seconds)
- Clear explanation of the conflict

### Test 3: Pre-submission Validation
**Setup:**
- Customer fills booking form with conflicting time

**Expected Behavior:**
- Validation occurs before form submission
- Clear error message prevents form submission
- User redirected back to time selection

## Performance Tests

### Test P.1: Multiple Conflict Checks
**Setup:**
- Customer with 5 existing bookings
- Barber with 10 existing bookings
- Request validation for overlapping time

**Expected Results:**
- Response time < 500ms
- Accurate conflict detection
- Proper error prioritization (customer conflicts first)

### Test P.2: Concurrent Booking Attempts
**Setup:**
- Multiple customers attempting to book same/overlapping slots

**Expected Results:**
- Only one booking succeeds per time slot
- Clear error messages for failed attempts
- No race conditions or data corruption

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Booking at Exact End Time
**Setup:**
- Existing booking: 10:00-11:00
- New booking: 11:00-12:00

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Should succeed (no overlap, just adjacent)

### Edge Case 2: Zero-Duration Gap
**Setup:**
- Existing booking: 10:00-11:00
- New booking: 11:00:01-12:00

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Should succeed (1-second gap is sufficient)

### Edge Case 3: Cross-Date Boundary
**Setup:**
- Existing booking: 23:30-00:30 (crosses midnight)
- New booking: 00:00-01:00

**Expected Result:**
- System should handle date boundaries correctly
