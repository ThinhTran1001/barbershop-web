# Booking Validation Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of booking validation logic that excludes completed bookings from validation checks. The implementation ensures that completed bookings are considered finalized and exempt from further validation constraints.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Validation Utilities (`back-end/utils/bookingValidation.js`)

#### New Functions Added:
- **`validateBookingModification(booking)`**: Checks if a booking can be modified, excluding completed bookings
- **`shouldApplyTimeRestrictions(booking)`**: Determines if time-based restrictions should apply (returns false for completed bookings)

#### Enhanced Functions:
- **`validateBookingCancellation(booking)`**: Updated to explicitly handle completed bookings with clear error messages

### 2. Updated Booking Controller (`back-end/controllers/booking.controller.js`)

#### Functions Modified:

##### `cancelBooking()`
- Now uses `validateBookingCancellation()` utility for consistent validation
- Applies time restrictions only when `shouldApplyTimeRestrictions()` returns true
- Completed bookings are exempt from the 2-hour cancellation rule

##### `updateBookingDetails()`
- Uses `validateBookingModification()` to check if booking can be edited
- Time restrictions (24-hour rule for customers) only apply to non-completed bookings
- Conflict checking excludes completed bookings from validation

#### Existing Functions (Already Correct):
- `createBooking()`: Already excludes completed bookings by only checking `['pending', 'confirmed']` statuses
- `checkAvailability()`: Already excludes completed bookings from conflict detection
- `createBookingFromBot()`: Already excludes completed bookings from conflict checking

## Validation Rules Summary

### For Completed Bookings:
- ❌ Cannot be cancelled
- ❌ Cannot be modified
- ✅ Exempt from time restrictions (2-hour cancellation rule, 24-hour modification rule)
- ✅ Excluded from conflict checking when creating new bookings
- ✅ Considered finalized and immutable

### For Pending/Confirmed Bookings:
- ✅ Can be cancelled (subject to time restrictions)
- ✅ Can be modified (subject to time restrictions)
- ✅ Subject to all validation rules and time constraints
- ✅ Included in conflict checking

### For Cancelled/No-Show Bookings:
- ❌ Cannot be cancelled again
- ❌ Cannot be modified
- ✅ Excluded from conflict checking
- ✅ Considered finalized

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All validation logic now uses centralized utility functions
2. **Clarity**: Clear separation between active and finalized bookings
3. **Performance**: Completed bookings are excluded from unnecessary validation checks
4. **Maintainability**: Validation rules are centralized and easy to modify
5. **Correctness**: Prevents invalid operations on completed bookings

## Usage Examples

```javascript
// Check if a booking can be cancelled
const cancellationResult = validateBookingCancellation(booking);
if (!cancellationResult.valid) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: cancellationResult.error });
}

// Check if time restrictions should apply
if (shouldApplyTimeRestrictions(booking)) {
  // Apply time-based validation rules
  const hoursDifference = (bookingTime - now) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
  if (hoursDifference < 2) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Cannot cancel within 2 hours' });
  }
}

// Check if a booking can be modified
const modificationResult = validateBookingModification(booking);
if (!modificationResult.valid) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: modificationResult.error });
}
```

## Testing

A test file has been created at `back-end/test/booking-validation.test.js` to verify the validation logic works correctly for all booking statuses.

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully excludes completed bookings from validation checks while maintaining proper validation for active bookings. This ensures that completed bookings are treated as finalized records that cannot be modified or cancelled, while still allowing appropriate operations on pending and confirmed bookings.
