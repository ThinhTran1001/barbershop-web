## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Notes

### API Endpoints to Create/Modify:
- `GET /api/barbers/available?date=YYYY-MM-DD&timeSlot=HH:MM` (make customer-accessible)
- `POST /api/barbers/auto-assign-for-slot` (new endpoint)
- Existing booking creation endpoint (ensure compatibility)

### Key Components:
- `SinglePageBooking.jsx` (main component)
- `BookingStepIndicator.jsx` (progress indicator)
- Modified `TimeSlotPicker.jsx` (no navigation)
- `BarberSelectionStep.jsx` (new component)

### State Management:
```javascript
const [bookingData, setBookingData] = useState({
  service: null,
  timeSlot: null,
  barber: null, // or 'random'
  customerInfo: null,
  currentStep: 1
});
```
